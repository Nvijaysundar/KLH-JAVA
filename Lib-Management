 Imagine you are designing a system for a library that needs to manage its collection of books. Each book has a unique identification number, a title, an author, and a genre. The library wants to implement a system that allows them to efficiently handle book transactions, such as checking out books, returning books, and keeping track of books in different genres.

Design a solution using Java's Collection framework that involves the use of LinkedList for maintaining a list of books, a Queue for handling book transactions in a first-come-first-served manner, and a Set for efficiently categorizing books by genre.

Here are the specific tasks to address:

Create a class named Book with attributes for the book's ID, title, author, and genre.

Implement a LibrarySystem class that includes:

A LinkedList to store the list of all books in the library.
A Queue to manage book transactions, such as checking out and returning books.
A Set for each genre, containing references to books of that genre.
Provide methods in the LibrarySystem class to:

Add a new book to the library.
Remove a book from the library (e.g., when it is checked out).
Enqueue a book transaction (e.g., when a user wants to check out a book).
Dequeue a book transaction (e.g., when a user completes the check-out process).
Categorize books by adding them to the respective genre sets.
Demonstrate how your system works by simulating a few book transactions, including adding books to the library, checking out books, and returning books.

Ensure that your implementation is efficient and follows best practices for using the LinkedList, Queue, and Set interfaces in the Java Collection framework.
