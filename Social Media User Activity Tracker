Social Media User Activity Tracker

You are tasked with developing a Java program to create a user activity tracker for a new social media platform. This platform aims to efficiently capture and analyze user activities, provide insights into popular posts, and identify active users.

User Class:

Design a User class that represents social media users. Each user should have a unique user ID and a username.
Activity Class:

Create an Activity class to model various user activities such as posts, likes, and comments. Each activity should be uniquely identified, have a type (e.g., "post," "like," "comment"), and include a timestamp.
SocialMediaTracker Class:

Develop a SocialMediaTracker class to manage user information and activities efficiently.
Utilize a Map<Integer, Set<Activity>> to store user activities. The user ID serves as the key, and the associated value is a set of activities.
Use a data structure (either LinkedList or Queue) to maintain the order of activities for each user.
Functionalities:

Implement the following functionalities within the SocialMediaTracker class:
Add User:
Provide a method to add a new user to the platform. Ensure that each user is assigned a unique user ID.
Record Activity:
Create a method to record user activities. Users can perform actions like posting, liking, or commenting. Each activity should be linked to a user and timestamped.
Display User Activity:
Design a method to display recent activities for a specified user. Identify the user by their user ID.
Display Popular Posts:
Develop a method to display the most popular posts based on the number of likes.
Display Active Users:
Create a method to present a list of active users based on recent activity.
Execution Loop:

Implement a loop allowing users to interact with the system, perform multiple operations, and exit when desired.
